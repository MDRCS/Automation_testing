# Automation_testing

    TIP :

    if you want to run tests each time on a whole folder for example `unit`
    go to `unittests in unit` -> `edit configuration` -> choose script path -> Target `/Users/MDRAHALI/Desktop/Learning_Roadmap/Automation_testing/TDD_Coding/tests/unit/
    pattern `*_test.py`` -> apply -> run tests


    - Unit test vs Intergration Test :

    Unit test is when you test one unit for example a class method
    Integration Test is when your test needs multiple classes and functions.

    TIP:

    to run all tests under the folder tests (unit, integration), go to `unittests in unit` -> `edit configuration`
    change target folder to -> Target `/Users/MDRAHALI/Desktop/Learning_Roadmap/Automation_testing/TDD_Coding/tests/
    apply -> run.
